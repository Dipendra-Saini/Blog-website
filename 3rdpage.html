            <p>
                If you are looking to start your week on a good note, then this motivation for the week will be all that you need to motivate yourself and bring yourself maximum happiness and efficiency throughout the week.
                <br>
                Now you have come to the main content of this article. Below is a well-explained list of the motivation for the weak quotes that will help you stay motivated throughout the week and attend maximum happiness, self-awareness, and achievement
            </p>
            <h2>1. “Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve.”</h2>
            <p>
                Your motivation cannot be fully complete if there’s nothing you are motivated about. You need to be motivated about something if your motivation is going to last for the week.
                <br>
                It is impossible to achieve anything which is not conceived by the mind first, and it is impossible to become that which you do not see.
                <br>
                That is why whatever it is you want to become you need to first conceive it in your mind and work towards it.
            </p>
            <h2>2. “The tragedy in life doesn’t lie in not reaching your goal. The tragedy lies in having no goal to reach.”</h2>
            <p>
                This is like adding coherence to number one.
                <br>
                Every achievement starts with goal setting. If your week is going to be successful you must set goals that must be met before the week runs out, and work towards achieving them. The deal behind this is when you set a goal you direct your energy to achieve that particular goal and you don’t leave anything to chance, but when you do not set a goal your energy is not confined to anything and you don’t really know what you are pursuing, and you end up achieving nothing.
                <br>
                So, the tragedy is not about not reaching goals, it’s about not setting any at all. This should be your motivation for the week.
            </p>
            <h2>3. “Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value.” – Albert Einstein</h2>
            <p>
                One of the primary problems the world has today is the pursuance of the wrong things. Success in its holistic form is not far-fetched, but because we don’t pursue it the right way we end up not achieving it.
                <br>
                It’s just like pursuing money. Pursuing money is like pursuing a harvest without sowing the seed. Money is an effect, not a cause, you can only reap what you sow.
            </p>
            <h2>4. “Everything you want is on the other side of fear.”</h2>
            <p>
                <i>If your dreams are not bigger than you, and does not scare you, then it is not really a dream, it is a mere nightmare</i>
                This is one of my best motivation quotes each week
                <br>
                On the level playing ground of success, your dreams should scare you. So it is ok to be afraid, like the fear of you are going to make it or not. But where this becomes totally wrong is when it stops you from doing what you’re supposed to do.
                <br>
                Fear is a natural phenomenon which shows you are human, but it still has the ability to stop you from achieving your goals for the week, for the year, and lifetime if you allow it.
            </p>
            <h2>5. “The only way to do great work is to love what you do.”</h2>
            <p>
                If I’m talking to an audience and I’m giving one hour to speak the only thing I can remember is when I started, I will be surprised when I’ll be signaled that my time was up. I’ll think I’ve only spent 10 minutes on the stage without knowing that I have spent over 1-hour talking. This is because I love what I do. I love speaking to people; I love motivating people; I do it effortlessly, that is why I do a great job in speaking because I love it.
            </p>
            <h2>6. “If opportunity doesn’t knock, build a door.” </h2>
            <p>
                One of the passengers explicitly talked about how to zero into opportunities effectively, and one of the things it mentioned was not only being at the right place at the right time but being the right person.
                <br>
                Opportunities are everywhere but the truth is, you are not the right person for every opportunity. The opportunities that will knock at your door which you will be the right person to take are opportunities that you have what it takes to take b.
                <br>
                Building a door in this context means preparing yourself for opportunities.
                <br>
                Keep getting yourself ready, build yourself until an opportunity comes which you can take, then take it effortlessly.
