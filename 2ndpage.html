                If you need more money to pay for college, chances are you will be applying for several college scholarships. A great scholarship essay helps the scholarship provider understand the real person behind the application and can be the key to winning the award (assuming you meet the other scholarship criteria).
            </p>
            <h2>1. Start the essay writing process early.</h2>
            <p>
                Leave yourself plenty of time to produce a well thought-out entry. Take the time to brainstorm your ideas, create an outline, and edit your entry as you would for any essay writing assignment for your English class.
            </p>
            <h2>2. Understand the scholarship provider’s overall mission and purpose.</h2>
            <p>
                Each scholarship provider is looking for students who meet certain criteria. Consider writing about an experience or interest that highlights your strong ties to the organization’s mission. Genuine passion and enthusiasm for your topic will show through in your essay writing.
            </p>
            <h2>3. Follow the scholarship essay instructions.</h2>
            <p>
                Make sure to follow all of the necessary steps and review them before submitting your scholarship essay. Trust us, some of the brightest students have missed out on the chance to earn scholarships dollars all because they neglected to follow instructions. You don’t want to fall into that category!
            </p>
            <h2>4. Steer clear from essay topics that focus on negativity or pessimism.</h2>
            <p>
                Scholarship committees would rather see how you overcame hardships and succeeded despite the obstacles in your path (or what you learned from the times you failed).
            </p>
            <h2>5. Don’t be afraid to get personal.</h2>
            <p>
                Share something about who you are. This is your chance to elaborate on elsewhere on your application you wouldn’t have had the opportunity to do so. Telling your story makes an essay genuine and ultimately more memorable to the scholarship committee.
            </p>
            <h2>6. Seek out writing advice and feedback.</h2>
            <p>
                Asking teachers, counselors, family members, or trustworthy friends for feedback on your essay will result in a better final product.
            </p>
            <h2>7. Yes, spelling and grammar matter.</h2>
            <p>
                Scholarship committees do notice grammar mistakes. Eveny tiny errors can distract a reader from your overall message. Before you submit your application make sure you take the time to proofread your essay from beginning to end.
            </p>
            <h2>8. Don’t give up!</h2>
            <p>
