                There isn’t one “right” way to achieve success as a college student, but there are tried-and-true tips that can help you do your best and make the most of your time in school. We enlisted help from Jason Martinez, recent college graduate and marketing coordinator at Redefine Marketing Group. Use this advice to start your student journey with confidence!

            <h2>1. Strong time-management skills</h2>
            <p>
                Having a solid time-management plan can help you stay on top of your workload without feeling overwhelmed. “Time management will grant you the ability to get as many assignments finished as possible with the least amount of stress,” Martinez says. Remember that study sessions don’t have to last all day (or night) to be effective!
                <br>
                “Use any little amount of free time you have to chip away at assignments, even if it’s only 20 minutes,” Martinez advises.
                <br>
                While you might not be able to write an entire paper in 30 minutes, you can take concrete steps that will make the longer study and writing sessions go smoother. Organize your thoughts, make an outline, review vocabulary terms—these little things add up.
            </p>
            <h2>2. Organization skills</h2>
            <p>
                Staying organized is another key ingredient to balancing your responsibilities and finding success as a college student. That doesn’t mean you have to have an immaculately color-coded organization system—taking some basic organizational steps can go a long way.
                <br>
                Keeping close tabs on due dates for homework can help you plan a schedule each week to make sure nothing falls through the cracks. Having a planner dedicated to schoolwork can also help you plan ahead so you have enough time to study for tests or complete larger projects.
            </p>
            <h2>3. The ability to work with others</h2>
            <p>
                Collaborating with classmates is an important part of college life, one that prepares you for the realities of the workplace. Martinez admits that working in groups isn’t always easy, but brushing up on your collaboration skills can make the process go more smoothly. “Figure out ways to effectively work against adversity and get the job done.”
            </p>
            <h2>4. Friends to support you</h2>
            <p>
                Making friends within your degree program means you’ll always have support and accountability, whether it’s studying for tests or swapping stories about the highs and lows of college life. “You’ll always have someone to rely on for help when needed, and it makes coursework more enjoyable when you have someone to relate to,” Martinez says. “Plus who knows? You might end up finding someone that’ll be a friend for life.”
            </p>
            <h2>5. Curiosity to learn more</h2>
            <p>
                Gaining new knowledge and skills is at the heart of your college experience. You’ll gain more from your time in school if you come with an open sense of curiosity and a desire to learn as much as possible. Try new things and ask questions whenever you can. “During your college experience, do as much as possible to learn and step outside of your comfort zone,” Martinez says.
